            <h2>About Galapagos</h2>
            <p>Located in the Pacific Ocean some 1,000 km from the South American continent, these 19 islands and the surrounding marine reserve have been called a unique ‘living museum and showcase of evolution’. Located at the confluence of three ocean currents, the Galápagos are a ‘melting pot’ of marine species. Ongoing seismic and volcanic activity reflects the processes that formed the islands. These processes, together with the extreme isolation of the islands, led to the development of unusual animal life – such as the land iguana, the giant tortoise and the many types of finch – that inspired Charles Darwin’s theory of evolution by natural selection following his visit in 1835.</p>

            <h2>If Burns?!</h2>
            <p>The Galapagos Islands are formed of lava piles and dotted with shield volcanoes, many of which are periodically active. The striking ruggedness of the arid landscape is accentuated by high volcanic mountains, craters, and cliffs. The largest of the islands, Isabela (Albemarle), is approximately 82 miles (132 km) long and constitutes more than half of the total land area of the archipelago; it contains Mount Azul, at 5,541 feet (1,689 metres) the highest point of the Galapagos Islands. The second largest island is Santa Cruz.</p>
            <p>The Galapagos Islands were discovered in 1535 by the bishop of Panama, Tomás de Berlanga, whose ship had drifted off course while en route to Peru. He named them Las Encantadas (“The Enchanted”), and in his writings he marveled at the thousands of large galápagos (tortoises) found there. Numerous Spanish voyagers stopped at the islands from the 16th century, and the Galapagos also came to be used by pirates and by whale and seal hunters. The area had been unclaimed for almost 300 years before colonization began on what is now Santa María Island in 1832, when Ecuador took official possession of the archipelago. The islands became internationally famous as a result of their being visited in 1835 by the English naturalist Charles Darwin; their unusual fauna contributed to the groundbreaking theories on natural selection presented in his On the Origin of Species (1859).</p>

            <h1>Facts</h1>
            <ul>
                <li>Unique Wildlife: The Galapagos Islands are home to many unique species found nowhere else on Earth, including the Galapagos Giant Tortoise, Marine Iguanas, and Galapagos Penguins.</li>
                <li>Darwin's Finches: The diverse range of finch species found on the islands played a crucial role in Charles Darwin's theory of evolution by natural selection.</li>
                <li>Volcanic Origins: The islands were formed by volcanic activity, and many of the volcanoes are still active today. Isabela Island, the largest in the archipelago, is one of the most volcanically active places on Earth.</li>
                <li>Marine Life: The waters surrounding the Galapagos are teeming with marine life, including sharks, rays, sea lions, and colorful fish. It's a popular destination for scuba diving and snorkeling.</li>
                <li>Giant Tortoises: The Galapagos Giant Tortoise is one of the most iconic species of the islands. These gentle giants can live for over 100 years and weigh up to 900 pounds.</li>
                <li>Unique Geography: Each island in the Galapagos has its own unique landscape and ecosystem, ranging from lush highlands to barren lava fields.</li>
                <li>Conservation: The Galapagos Islands are a UNESCO World Heritage Site and a marine reserve, protected to preserve their unique biodiversity.</li>
                <li>Pirate History: In the past, the islands were frequented by pirates and whalers who used them as a source of fresh water and food.</li>
                <li>Remote Location: The Galapagos Islands are located about 1,000 kilometers (620 miles) off the coast of Ecuador in the Pacific Ocean, making them one of the most remote archipelagos in the world.</li>
                <li>Inspiration for Science: Charles Darwin's observations during his visit to the Galapagos Islands in 1835 played a pivotal role in the development of his theory of evolution, which he later published in his book "On the Origin of Species."</li>
